# The "react-example-crud" project
This project is a simple CRUD that must test some different stuff together.

- The client-side is a React + Redux app based.
- The server-side is built in NodeJS (Express) and works like an API server.

This application uses Sequelize ORM to manage relational database and maintain it's data.
We will use Passport to build a middleware that will respond for all authorization in every request call from frontend to the backend.

Hope this simple project help everyone in studying, get new ideas and to take a look into another way to program with all of these fantastic technologies and it's features :)

If you have some suggestion, please let me know about it!

# Server-Side
Located in the "/server/" folder, here becomes the NodeJS Express application.

# Client-Side
Located in the "/client/" folder, here is the React app. Built with the package "create-react-app" and working with Redux.
