### Summary
The main idea of this project is to create an application with relational database exposing data through API services using NodeJS + Express. The front-end is a React + Redux application that manages state populated by the API based in each operation basically.

Besides the registration the project has a simple login/logout feature made using HOC (High Order Component) in React-side that calls an authorization middleware in the API backend, as a layer, that authorizes the user to access all the stuff - if everything is OK.

> - The **client-side** is a React + Redux app based.
> - The **server-side** is built in NodeJS (Express) and works like an API server.
> - This application uses Sequelize ORM to manage relational database and maintain it's data.
> - The [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport) is basically a Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.

I didn't think it was interesting to use Flow for data typing, instead I chose to use only prop-types to cover the type and obligation for React Components, when it's necessary.

#### Server-Side
The NodeJS Express application, located in the ```/server/``` folder.

Inside it's scope use ```npm install``` to install all dependencies and ```npm start``` to run the server application after that.

> - Be sure that the database is working before starting the server.
> - All the database connections you need (for each environment) are in ```/server/config/database.json```.

#### Client-Side
In the ```/client/``` folder we have the client-side React application.

This client was built using the official Facebook [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) npm package. This package basically create a working React application, configured with minimal dependency and granting imediate work with no configuration for features like Babel, Webpack, and another stuff (because it's already done).

To install npm dependencies use ```npm install``` and finally ```npm start``` to run the React application.

#### TDD + BDD
We have some tests too to be sure that our client and server-side API are working succesfully.

There some tests I wrote in Mocha + Chai, disposed in ```/server/test/```.

Mocha is used to build the tests and Chai to configure the asserts (TDD) and the behaviours (BDD) to improve the test accuracy against the way we can use the API and also the way we should take care about errors. This way we know it's OK for every case.

You can run the tests just entering the test folder and type in terminal: ```npm run test``` - It's configured to run and compile with Babel for ES6 in then server "package.json".
