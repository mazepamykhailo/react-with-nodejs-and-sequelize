# The "react-example-crud" project (in development)
This project is a simple CRUD that must test some different stuff together.

- The client-side is a React + Redux app based.
- The server-side is built in NodeJS (Express) and works like an API server.

This application uses Sequelize ORM to manage relational database and maintain it's data.

We are using Passport to build a middleware. This middleware will intercept all requests, verify their data if necessary and proceed with the authorization or not depending on it's logic.

I hope this simple project could help new developers to get a direction, some ideas and to take a look into another way to program with all of these fantastic technologies and it's features :)

If you have some suggestion, please let me know about it!

# Server-Side
Located in the "/server/" folder, here becomes the NodeJS Express application.

# Client-Side
Located in the "/client/" folder, here is the React app. Built with the package "create-react-app" and working with Redux.
